Starbucks

Today I have a scoop on one of the cornerstones of modern civilization.
It's a place where you pay $7 for coffee that make you feel fancy for five minutes until you realize you just paid rent on a cup of beans.

Starbucks is like a cult. You walk in and suddenly you're part of this elite club where everyone there knows the secret language. "I'll take a Venti latte, oat milk, two pumps of vanilla and a sprinkle of cinnamon". It's not a coffee order. It's a spell from Harry Potter.

And what's with the sizes? Tall, Grande, Venti.
Tall is an english word. Wheras other two are Italian words.
Why can't they just say small, medium and large?
But, maybe not. Because, that's how they devised the secret language.

The most dreadful moment at Starbucks is when they ask you for your name.
They must have a name to fulfill your order.
And it's always a gamble even with the simplest names.

The best part at Starbucks is their seasonal drinks.
Come fall and everyone is walking around with Pumpkin Spiced latte.
It's not a drink. It's a personality trait.
People are like "You don't like PSL? Are you even living?"

Another thing about Starbucks is it's everywhere.
You go to a mall, you go grocery shopping, you go to a hospital - everywhere.
In fact, recently, federal authorities figured out about an underground drug smuggling tunnel at US/Mexico border. You know how? It had its own Starbucks.

It's just not coffee. It's an experience. Have fun with it!
