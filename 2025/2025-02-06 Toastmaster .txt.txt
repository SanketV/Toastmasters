Tonight's theme is Superbowl.

As you know, Superbowl is a massive cultural event and a major cultural phenomenon.

It started in 1967. It has gained immense popularity since then.

It's not a game. It's a spectacle. 
It's known for its halftime shows featuring major music stars and expensive and creative commercials. I remember a year or two ago - they brought Dr Dre/Snoop Dogg and others and that was quite a show.

This year - Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans

You might wonder why it's called Super Bowl.
There was a toy his children played called super ball. 
Football games were played in a bowl shaped stadiums.
Hollywood bowl.
Super Bowl is catchy and it stuck.

There are four quarters in the game.
There are different roles in the game too.
Such as - wide receiver, tight end, linemen, quarterback etc.

That reminds me of an incident.

Superbowl is also a big money spinner economy-wise.
Roughly 54 million pounds of Avacado is used to make guacamole.
50 million cases of beer, 28 million pounds of chips and some 12 million chicken wings are consumed.
Rough estimate is 12.5 million pizzas are ordered on Superbowl Sunday.


That reminds me we should never forget the real heroes of this day.
The guys who deliver your pizzas.

If you're a Cowboys fan, I feel for you. 
They have won Superbowl five different times which is a huge achievement.
But the last one was in 1996 which is 28 years ago.

That reminds me -
What do you call a group of 50 men watching Superbowl on TV?
Cowboys.
