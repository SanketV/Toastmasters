Groundhog Day

Slide 1:
	Relesed in 1993.
	Writer started it out as a drama based on Buddhism.
	But later, studio turned it into a rom com.

	
Slide 2:
	Premise of the movie.
	Time loop, forced to relive the same day, February 2nd, in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, over and over again.
	Initially, it is funny because Phil is a jerk, a smug and a very selfish man.
	Since he starts reliving the same day, he uses the foreknowledge to his own advantage. He manipulates people, gets what he wants, indulges in his desires.

Slide 3:
	What would you do if there are no consequences?
	Eats all the pastries, robs a bank, manipulates a woman to sleep with him that he was not even interested in. And continues to pursue his love interest - Rita.
	The filmmaker has only focused on one rule that is rebirth. And not karma.
	
Slide 4:
	Now doing all the things repeatedly does not bring him lasting happiness.
	The thrill wears off and the emptiness returns.
	He becomes more miserable before doing all these things.
	Now he is in despair. He is in depression. He has no future and he cannot escape.
	Imagine when you think you can do anything, you can get anything, you can get anyone and still you feel depressed. Is it possible? Yes, so many celebrities get depressed.

	Now what does he do?
	He attempts to commit suicide. Does he die? No.
	He tries a series of attempts. But he cannot escape the loop.

Slide 5:
	After hitting rock bottom, he realizes that he cannot change what is going on around him.
	But he can atleast change himself.
	Now he stops his selfish pursuits and starts improving himself.
	He focuses on people around him. Who needs help and who he can help?
	He saves a boy from a tree every day. Fixes a flat tire for old ladies.
	Saves a man from choking to death.

Slide 6:
	He also learns French, learns ice sculpting, learns playing piano at a professional level, reads countless books.

	This transformation is the heart of the film. Phil learns that true fulfillment doesn't come from external pleasures or a lack of consequences. It comes from inside, from a commitment to growth and a genuine connection with others. He learns to love his community, to find joy in the small details, and to become the best version of himself, not for anyone else's approval, but for his own. 

Slide 7:
	At the end of the movie, Rita accepts him as he has become a better man.
	He wakes up to a new day.

	There's one video that says Phil lived the same day for 12 years.
	Writer/Director said in one interview that it could've taken him 10 to 30 years considering all the skills he acquired and how many times he might've failed.

	In Buddhist term, he attained Nirvana. In Hindu term, he attained Moksha from the cycle of birth and death.
