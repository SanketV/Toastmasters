• Tyranny of too much • 
The paradox of choice.

Have you ever spent 30 minutes scrolling through Netflix and ended up watching nothing?
Have you ever spent 20 minutes looking through menu at a restaurant and not finding anything you want to order?
And, have you seen anyone(including yourself) standing in a closet full of fine clothes and lamenting that there's nothing good to wear

Fellow toastmasters and guests, welcome to the modern life where we have everything except peace of mind.

Part 1:
	In modern world, there is a dogma for freedom and choice - that more is better. More options equal more freedom, which equals greater happiness. Sounds logical, right?

	But according to psychologist Barry Schwartz, author of The Paradox of Choice, the opposite is happening. The more options we have, the less satisfied we become.

	Imagine going to the store, you want to buy a toothpaste. There's twenty different brands and types. Whitening, Tartar control, Gel, Charcoal, Herbal or Emotional Support? 
	You want to buy a milk - there are 30 different varieties including oat milk, soy milk, almond milk and a milk that identifies as low fat creme.

Part 2:
	We live in a time our grandparents would call paradise.
	Back then, there was one phone company, one job for life and maybe two types of coffee: black or with milk.

	Now, we live in an era known as gig economy. To order coffee at Starbucks, you need to have taken two days course to know all the names.

	Schwartz says the sheer number of options leads us to Choice Overload and its cousin Decision Paralysis.

	Think back to that milk aisle. While growing up, you might've just brought red cap or blue cap milk. Now you read all the labels what contains what and how much nutrition each has.

Part 3:
	Schwartz divides people into two groups:

	Maximizers — who want the best option.
	Satisficers — who go for good enough.

	Maximizers are those who read every online review before buying a phone.
	They compare megapixels, processor speeds, battery life and what not.
	Problem with this approach is they're less happy with the other group. They're prone to decision paralysis and tend to feel more regret.

	Satisficers, on the other hand, say:
	“Does it work? Does it fit my budget? Great — I’ll take it.”
	And they walk out smiling. Good enough is their mantra.
	They may not have the best, but they are content, satisfied, and free from the tyranny of constant comparison.

	Now, you might think the maximizer ends up with the better phone — and maybe they do.
	But the satisficer ends up with the better life.

Part 4:
	Schwartz cites a famous study: A gourmet food store sets up a display of jam. First, they offered 24 different flavors. Then, they offered only 6. Which display attracted more attention? The one with 24. But with which display did they sell more? The small display generated ten times more purchases.

	More choice draws us in, but too much choice shuts us down. We become paralyzed by the possibility of making a mistake, and that paralysis keeps us from making a satisfying decision at all. It's easy to think that a different choice would've been better.

	Now remember the times when you didn't or don't have to make a decision.
	When you were in school and your mom used to pack your lunch.
	She didn't give you a menu, you ate what was there.
	Now maybe you cook for your spouse or your spouse cooks for you.
	You don't give each other a menu, you eat what is served. Your life is simple.

	If you remember Steve Jobs, he used to wear same clothes everywhere. Black turtle and jeans. Why? He was made of money. He wanted to conserve his energy for bigger decisions. And therefore every morning same outfit.
	Mark Zuckerburg of Facebook adopted the same lifestyle for a while.
	He always used to wear a grey t-shirt. Simple life.

	For the same reason, Chipotle has the simplest menu you can imagine.

Part 5:
	Friends, the Paradox of Choice teaches us that boundless freedom isn't always liberating; most of the times, it’s just exhausting. But Schwartz doesn't leave us in despair. He gives us the tools to reclaim our satisfaction.

	Limit your options. You don’t need 10 streaming platforms — one will do.
	Be a satisficer. Choose what’s “good enough” and move on.
	Practice gratitude. Instead of obsessing over what you didn’t pick, enjoy what you have.

	Because in the end, happiness doesn’t come from having everything — it comes from appreciating something.

So the next time you’re stuck on Netflix, remember:
It’s not that there’s nothing good to watch —
It’s that there’s too much.

Thank you!
