Have you ever felt like an utter failure in your life? 
So disappointed in yourself that you might've considered ending your life? 
Or might've just thought what's the point of living?

Fellow toastmasters, we're seven days away from Christmas.
I thought it would be apt to talk about one of the Christmas staple movies which is 'It's a wonderful life'.

Raise your hand if you've seen it.

It's the story of George Bailey a man who has spent his entire life sacrificing his personal dreams for the sake of his community.

It is a movie about a man who feels like a failure. It’s a movie about the "ordinary" life—and the extraordinary lie we tell ourselves: that if we haven't done something "big," we haven't done anything at all.

Set in the fictional town of Bedford Falls on Christmas Eve, 1945, It’s a Wonderful Life is the story of George Bailey, a man who has spent his entire life sacrificing his personal dreams for the sake of his community.

1. The Life of George Bailey
The film is told largely through a series of flashbacks shown to Clarence Odbody, a "Second Class" Angel who needs to save George to earn his wings. We see that since childhood, George has been a selfless protector:
He saved his brother Harry from drowning (losing hearing in one ear in the process).
He prevented a grieving pharmacist from accidentally poisoning a customer.
As an adult, he gives up his dreams of world travel and college to manage the family business, the Bailey Building and Loan, after his father’s death. This small business is the only thing protecting the townspeople from the greedy land-grabber Mr. Potter.

2. The Crisis
George marries his childhood sweetheart, Mary, and they have four children. However, on Christmas Eve, George’s scatterbrained Uncle Billy loses $8,000 of the company’s money. Mr. Potter finds the money and hides it, knowing that its loss will lead to the bankruptcy of the Building and Loan and George's arrest.

Driven to despair and believing he is "worth more dead than alive" due to his life insurance policy, George prepares to jump from a bridge.

3. The "Unborn" Sequence
Before George can jump, Clarence leaps into the water first, forcing George to rescue him. When George wishes he had never been born, Clarence grants the wish to show him what the world would look like without him:

Bedford Falls is now Pottersville, a seedy, cynical town.
His brother Harry is dead because George wasn't there to save him.
The soldiers Harry saved in WWII are also dead.
His mother is a cold, lonely widow, and his wife Mary is a timid, unmarried librarian.

4. The Resolution
Realizing that his life truly mattered, George begs to live again. He returns to his "real" life, embracing his family even though he still faces arrest. However, his wife Mary and the townspeople—whom George had helped for years—bring a flood of donations to cover the missing $8,000.
The movie ends with the town singing "Auld Lang Syne" and a bell ringing on the Christmas tree, signifying that Clarence has finally earned his wings.


Frank Capra made this movie after serving in World War II.
He aimed to create something meaningful.

1. 🕊️ Affirming the Individual and Battling Despair
After serving in World War II and returning to a changed, anxious America, Capra wanted to create a film that strengthened the individual's belief in themselves and offered a message of hope.
He sought to remind audiences—and himself—that despite financial struggles, unfulfilled dreams, or personal despair, every single life has value and impact. The film serves as a powerful antidote to nihilism, using the fantastic device of Clarence the angel to make this impact tangible.

2. ⛪ A Spiritual and Moral Vision
Capra, a Catholic, often said that his movies were driven by the concepts found in the Sermon on the Mount. He intended It's a Wonderful Life to be a powerful and artistic expression of Christian values.

Key Themes: The movie is steeped in themes of charity, mercy, justice, and self-sacrifice. Capra even reportedly mentioned that one motivation was "to combat a modern trend toward atheism," by showing that spiritual forces (like angels) and divine love are active in the world, often working through ordinary people like George Bailey.

3. 🏡 Upholding Community and Common Man


Dharma vs. Kama: In Hinduism, life is a balance between Kama (personal desires/pleasures) and Dharma (righteous duty). George’s life is a constant battle between his Kama (wanting to travel and build big things) and his Dharma (staying to run the Building and Loan to protect the town).

Serve the community.

 Nishkam Karma: This is the practice of "selfless action performed without attachment to the fruits." For years, George helps people build homes without getting rich or famous. He does it because it is the right thing to do. The ending of the film is the Karmic Fruit of those actions returning to him when he is in his greatest need

Maya (Illusion): When George is on the bridge, he is trapped in Maya. He sees only the "shadow" of his life—the debt and the failure. Clarence acts as a Guru who removes the veil of illusion, showing George the Atman (the true soul/essence) of his life’s work.


The Theology of the Individual: Christianity teaches that every person is created by God with a specific purpose. George’s "unborn" sequence is a cinematic proof of the biblical idea that "the hairs on your head are all numbered." It asserts that no human life is an accident.

The Burden of the Cross: George Bailey is a "suffering servant" figure. He repeatedly "dies to himself"—sacrificing his college funds, his honeymoon, and his career ambitions—so that others may live in dignity. This mirrors the Christian call to carry one’s cross for the sake of the community.

The Role of Grace: George cannot save himself from the $8,000 deficit through his own works. He reaches a point of total "spiritual bankruptcy." His salvation comes through Grace—first through the divine intervention of Clarence, and then through the unearned, overflowing generosity of his friends.

Adapt to life.
	- We all make plans for our future. Mostly, big things and only positive things.
	  We never think about what if.
	  People in Ukraine never thought they will be forced to leave their home and country.
	  George teaches us that you adapt to your situation and move forward.
	  I remember one example about a newbie explorer.
	  He gets a map of the river Ganges in India.
	  He starts following the map and starts walking along the river.
	  After two days, the map doesn't align with the river.
	  And he says this river is wrong. It doesn't comply with my map.
	  He quits his journey and returns home.
