We always retain the ability to choose our attitude.

No matter what life experiences we confront, we always have the inner-freedom to decide our attitude, and to remain true to our character and duty.

“If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death, human life cannot be complete.”


While working in a camp hospital, Frankl noticed the death rate spiked the week between Christmas and New Year’s in 1944. He attributed the dramatic increase to the number of prisoners who were naively holding out hope for liberation before Christmas. As the end of the year drew closer and it became clear that their situation was unchanged, they lost courage and hope. This in turn impacted their power of resistance and their ability to survive.

Frankl refers several times to the words of Nietzsche: “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”

Frankl comes to the conclusion that there is no general answer to the meaning of life. Each person must answer the question for themselves. We find our own unique meaning based on our circumstances, our relationships and our experiences. Life is essentially testing us, and the answer is revealed in how we respond.

Therefore, the meaning of life is not found on some mountaintop, rather it is revealed daily and hourly, in our choice to take the right action and to perform our duties and responsibilities.


Frankl claims there are really only two types of people; decent human beings and indecent human beings. Both can be found everywhere. They penetrate every group and every society.
