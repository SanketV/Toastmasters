Theme - Small talk

I used to abominate or abhor small talk.
But I later realized humans are social animals. And therefore I must be a social animal.
And small talk is a tool to be all social.

Generally, when you see someone you say "How are you?" and the other person say - good, fine. It doesn't go anywhere. It's very formal. 

Another way to start a small talk is just say "What's up?"
The main difference is when you say "What's up?", you're inviting the other person to talk about anything.
You're basically asking "What's up in your mind?". Talk to me. And it's very likely you will begin your small talk successfully.

Now if you're a cool person, you don't say "What's up?". 
You say something else. It should be cool.

You say "What up?"
When I said this first time to one of my colleagues, and he said you forgot "is".
But, I'm pretty sure that's how you say it. "What up?"

And if you're way cooler than the cool people. I mean like the coolest of all. 
You don't even say that. You say something different.
You say "Whaddup?" "Whaddup?" 

If you want you can all share your thoughts on how you start your small talk.
