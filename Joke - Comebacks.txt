We’ve all been there: someone says something rude to us and our instinct is to strike back with a quick-witted comeback. 

Let me ask you a question.
Has it ever happened to you that you were minding your own business, doing your own thing
and someone makes a snide remark about you? Or shoots sarcasm at you?

And you didn't have anything to say back? Precisely, you didn't have a comeback line.

One of the Seinfeld episodes was about this. Its title was Comeback.

George was in an executive meeting. They had brought Shrimps for everyone.
George was stuffing himself like he was at a cookout party.

One of his colleagues comes over to him and says
"Hey George, the Ocean called. They're runnin out of shrimps"
And everybody starts laughing.

George couldn't think of a comeback line until later that night. 

The jerkstore called. They're running out of you.

What's the difference? You're their all-time bestseller.

How awesome would it be if there's a site where you can review all your colleagues.
"Chad in payroll can't read emails for shit. But he brings donuts once in a while."


Research says there is always one person in the team that annoys everyone.
If that person leaves the team everyone's life would become easier.
If you think about your team, you should have that one person too.
Think about it. How much annoying that person is.
If you can't think of anyone, then you should quit your job. Because, that's definitely you.
