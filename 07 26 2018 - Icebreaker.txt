Speech day - July 26th 2018
* start a well-known idiom and finish it with something different. e.g. A douche doesn't fall far from a bag.

When I signed up for a speech, I didn't know you have to speak about youself in icebreaker speech. And I thought, what the hell?

Back when I was in college in late 90s in India, I always wanted to move away from my city where I was born and grew up. In fact, I was trying to find a job in Bangalore which everyone knows about these days. I used to submit my resumes to numerous recruiters and job ads. As it turned out, before I got an opportunity to go to Bangalore, I got an opportunity to come to US. And I started my journey in year 2000 with 2 suitcases, one college degree and one certificate in Java.

I distictly remember the flight was an hour away from landing at JFK airport and I was wide awake thinking "Was it worth it? Was it worth it to leave your family and friends which I had very few and come half way across the world?"

I didn't have any illusion of a luxurious life. But, I was certainly not prepared to commute by buses in Los Angeles. Sometimes 2 and half hours one way just to reach work. I realized I got enrolled in a training of lifetime that mostly every immigrant goes through.

However, it was simply amazing to be on your own in a new country where people were so friendly and helpful.
It was so amazing to see the giant skyscrapers in New York City and unbelievable theme parks in LA.
And it was mind-bogglingly amazing to learn about the most important American invention in hundred years that has affected millions of lives globally. 
The fast food. Back in 2000, I didn't know about the existence of donuts, tacos and burritos.
As you can imagine, I went nuts with them three times a day for next three months.

Many things happened for me for the first time in the US. Got my first real paycheck, my first apartment, my first car. And yes, the most important, my first tax return.

After almost two decades now, I think of US as my foster parent which nurtured and helped define me for the better part of my life.

I've been working as a Software Engineer all these years. And I have worked in numerous companies. And I think it's one of the best jobs in the world. And I don't know why I think that. It's either I love coding too much or I love browsing at work too much. I can't decide.

I'm so glad I got a chance to learn about great Americans over the years. And there are innumerable. But, my few favorites are the great Abraham Lincoln, the versatile Fredrick Douglass and everyone's favorite Snoop Dogg. If you don't know who Snoop Dogg is, you might want to freshen up your modern history.

I live with my wife and an eight year old daughter in Plano. We've been together for 12 years. Sometimes, I feel lucky that I found her. I mean I literally found her. In literal sense. Someday I'll talk about that. 

Today when I think about the time when I was about to land in New York and asked myself "Was it worth it?". And I can say with great gusto that yes, absolutely. With life, liberty and ever-fumbling pursuit of happiness, I think I've achieved the much-coveted American Dream!

Thank you all!
