Speech day - July 26th 2018

Back when I was in college in late 90s in India, I always wanted to move away from my city where I was born and grew up. In fact, I was trying to find a job in Bangalore city which everyone knows about these days. I used to submit my resumes to numerous recruiters and job ads. As it turned out, before I got an opportunity to go to Bangalore, I got an opportunity to come to America in year 2000. And I started my journey with 2 suitcases, one college degree and one Java certificate.

I distictly remember the flight was an hour away from landing at JFK airport and I was wide awake thinking "Was it worth it? Was it worth it to leave your family and friends which I had very few and come half way across the world?"

I didn't have any illusion of a luxurious life. But, I was certainly not prepared to commute by buses in Los Angeles. Sometimes 2 and half hours one way just to reach work. I realized I got enrolled in a training of lifetime that mostly every immigrant goes through.

It was simply amazing to be on your own in a new country. How friendly and helpful people were. And I was introduced to the most important American invention ever that has affected millions of lives globally.  The american fast food. I was introduced to donuts and coffee. Burritos and Tacos which I never heard before. 

Many things happened for me first time. First real paycheck. First apartment. First Car. And, yes, first tax return.

After few years as I grew older, I started thinking of US as my foster parent which shaped my life.

I've been working as a Software Engineer for 18 years now. And I have worked in numerous companies. And I think it's one of the best jobs in the world. And I don't know why I think that. It's either I love coding too much or I love browsing at work too much. Does anyone think they have best job too?

I'm so glad I got a chance to learn about great American men. And they are innumerable. But, my few favorites are the great Abraham Lincoln, the versatile Fredrick Douglass and everyone's favorite Snoop Dogg. If you don't know who Snoop Dogg is, you might want to freshen up your modern history.

I live with my wife and an eight year old daughter in Plano. And I think I've achieved the much-coveted American Dream.

And today when I think about the time when I was about to land in New York and asked myself "Was it worth it?". And I can say with great gutso that yes, absolutely. American dream is still alive.
