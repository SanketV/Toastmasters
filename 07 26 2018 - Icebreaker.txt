* start a well-known idiom and finish it with something different. e.g. A douche doesn't fall far from a bag.

Back when I was in college in late 90s in India, I always wanted to move out of my city where I was born and grew up. In fact, I was trying to find a job 1000 miles away in Bangalore. I used to submit my resumes to numerous recruiters and job ads. As it turned out, before I got an opportunity to go there, I got an opportunity to come to US. And, so I started my journey in year 2000 with 2 suitcases, one college degree and one Java certificate.

I distictly remember the flight was an hour away from landing at JFK airport and I was wide awake thinking "Was it worth it? Was it worth it to leave your family and friends which I had very few and come half way across the world?"

Though it was exciting and I didn't have any illusion of a luxurious life. But, I was certainly not prepared to commute by buses in Los Angeles. Sometimes 2 and half hours one way just to reach work. Then I realized I got enrolled in a training of lifetime that mostly every immigrant goes through.

However, it was simply amazing to be on your own in a new country where people were so friendly and helpful.
It was so amazing to see the giant skyscrapers in Manhattan, unbelievable theme parks in LA and glitzy casinos in Vegas.
It was mind-bogglingly amazing to learn about the most important American invention in human history that has affected millions of lives all over the world. 
The American fast food. 
Deep fried onion rings, fries with nacho cheese, supreme baja chalupa, spicy jalapeno poppers, oreo chocolate McFlurry, grape flavored slurpee, double chocolate java chip frappuccino. 
Oh, boy! Yes, as you can imagine, I still get piss-ass drunk on this stuff like Charlie Sheen on white powder. 

Many great things happened for me for the first time in the US. Got my first real paycheck, my first credit card, my first apartment, my first car. And yes, most importantly, my first tax return.

After almost two decades now, I think of this country as my foster parent which nurtured, nourished and helped define me for who I am.

In the beginning years, after working in IT departments of numerous companies in California and Texas, I was so humbled to learn about different traditions, different cuisines and different languages. I had no idea that India had exported this much of diversity to America.

I love my job. Yeah. As a software engineer, I think, it's one of the best jobs in the world. But, sometimes I'm not entirely sure why I think that. It's either I love coding too much or I love browsing at work too much. I can't decide.

I'm so glad I got a chance to learn about great Americans over the years. And there are innumerable. But, my few favorites are the great Abraham Lincoln, the versatile Fredrick Douglass and super terrific Snoop Dogg. Say all you want, but he did elevate the social status of a certain group of people in modern world.

I live with my wife and an eight year old daughter in Plano. My wife and I've been together for 12 years. Sometimes, I feel lucky that I found her. I mean I literally found her. In its true literal sense! Someday I'll talk about that.

Today when I think about the time when I was about to land in New York and asked myself "Was it worth it?", I can say with great gusto that yes, absolutely.

In the midst of life, liberty and ever-fumbling pursuit of happiness, I think I've managed to achieve the much-coveted American Dream! 

Thank you all!
