Have you ever noticed the biggest celebration in the world — happening at the exact same time everywhere — is New Year?

Different countries, different cultures…
same disappointments.

Every year we treat New Year like it’s a giant software update for humans.
Don't worry - version 2026 is here.

People are like thank god it's a new year. Last year sucked.

Have you noticed - at new year's party people yelling - “This is OUR year!” ?
No it’s not. It’s January 1st. Relax.

Calendar is a concept invented by humans to organize our lives.

But somehow we all believe that when the date changes, all our problems will go away.

New Year’s Eve is the only night where people think staying up late will change their personality.

At new year's parties you hear people - “New year, new me!”
No… same you. Maybe hungover and tired.

We count down like we’re launching a rocket.
We take so much pleasure in watching a ball drop like an angel coming down to rid us of our worries.

Do you know what else we do?
We make new year resolutions.
Resolution is like an upgrade to our lives.

Most of the time, we treat it like a free trial period.
It's like hey Spotify, I don’t like your ads. I don’t like that I can’t skip the songs. 
I love to upgrade. But I don’t wanna spend my dough.

So trial expires. And we are back to our old life.
I’ve been trying to make this one resolution work for many years now. Waking up early.

This year I was like - this year will be different. This time I am serious.
It's third week of January. 
I am already planning a big comeback next year.
Because nothing says self-improvement like pretending next year will be different.
