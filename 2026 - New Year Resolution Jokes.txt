Joke:
Every year we treat New Year’s like it’s a software update for humans.
Same bugs…
same bad habits…
but at midnight we’re like, “Relax, it’s Version 2026.”
People at New Year’s parties are always yelling, “This is OUR year!”
No it’s not.
It’s January 1st.
Gym membership sign up goes insanely up.
New Year’s Eve is the only night where people think staying up late will change their personality.
At midnight everyone’s like, “New year, new me!”
No… same you. Maybe hungover and tired.
We count down like we’re launching a rocket.


“Why do we wait for a new year? A calendar is just a concept—like a traffic light in the desert, it looks official, but nothing actually stops. I thought the new year would change my life… turns out it just changes the numbers on a piece of paper.”

Resolution is like an upgrade to your life. Most of the time, we treat it like a free trial period.
Hey Spotify, I don’t like your ads. I don’t like that I can’t skip the songs. I would like to upgrade. But I don’t wanna pay for it.

So January ends and the free trial expires. And we are back to our old life.

I’ve been trying to make this one resolution work for many years now. Waking up early.

Every year I am like - this year will be different. This time I am serious.
This year my free trial of resolution expired before January ended.
I am planning a big comeback next year.



“Every New Year people make three promises: this year will be different, this time they’re serious, and by February… they’re already planning a strong comeback next January.”
