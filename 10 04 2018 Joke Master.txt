Supreme court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh is in the news. For all the wrong reasons.
If any of you saw Dr. Ford's testimony last week, it was extremely powerful.

Anyway, so Kavanugh's classmate was in the news yesterday.
He said when they were in high school, Kavanaugh was very future-oriented.
He was always into planning his future. 
Even when he was at parties. Or especially at the parties.

So the reporter asks how he would plan for his future at the parties.
The classmate says at parties Brett Kavanaugh would always have beer cups in both hands.

He said Kavanaugh believed that was the secret of his health.
Because he thought having beer cups in each hand is a balanced diet.

The classmate also talked about how one time Kavanaugh got into a fight with some guy at a bar when they were discussing philosophy.
The guy was saying "Money is not everything. Money can't buy happiness."
And Kavanaugh's argument was "Yes it can if it's used to buy beer."
