It's already August. Just 2 months away from Halloween.
Do you guys know about Jimmy Kimmel's Halloween segment parents tell their kids on the next day of Halloween that they ate their candy. 
And they record their crying kids. And everyone laughs when they watch the video.

Scripture says God is our Father.
And sometimes he likes to joke with his kids too.

A woman named Kiki was praying. 
Kiki said, "God!?" God responded, "Yes?" And Kiki said, "Can I ask a question?" "sure, my child." God said. "God, what is a million years to you?" God said, "A million years to me is only a second." "Hmmm," Kiki wondered. Then she asked, "God, what is a million dollars worth to you?" God said, "A million dollars to me is as a penny." So the woman said, "God, can I have a penny?" 
And God cheerfully said, "Sure! Just a second."

God is also our shepherd, healer and helper. And so are the parents to their kids. 
But, sometimes, parents play mean joke on their kids. So does God! I mean, REAL MEAN!

In the beginning, when God created the earth, he put Adam there.

And one day, Adam was sitting under a tree sad and lonely.

God asked "Hey Adam, why you so mopey? What's wrong with you?"

Adam said "What do you think? I don't have anyone around. Nobody to talk to".

So, God said he was going to make Adam a companion and that it would be a woman. 

Adam said "Okay. What would be a woman like?"

God said, "The woman will make food for you, and when you discover clothes she'll wash it for you. When you have a house, she will clean it."

Adam said "That sounds great."

God said "Wait. There's more. She will always agree with every decision you make. And when you two disagree, she will always be the first to apologize. And she will love you like you're a little puppy."

Adam got excited. "That sounds terrific. When can you send her?"

So, God said "Wait. There's more. A companion like that will cost you."

Adam asked  "What? What will it cost?"

"An arm and a leg." said God.

So Adam says, "What?"

He takes a moment and thinks it through. All those things sounded nice. But, what will he do without an arm and a leg?

So he goes back and says "God, what can I get for a rib?" 

And as you know what happened after that.
