"Wait up!" That's what kids say. They don't say "wait", they say "Wait up! Hey, wait up!" 'Cause when you're little, your life is up. The future is up. Everything you want is up. "Wait up! Hold up! Shut up! Mom, I'll clean up! Let me stay up!" Parents of course are just the opposite. Everything is down. "Just calm down. Slow down. Come down here. Sit down. Put that down."

 One Zen student said, "My teacher is the best. He can go days without eating."

The second said, "My teacher has so much self-control, he can go days without sleep."

The third said, "My teacher is so wise that he eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's tired."

Q: Why was Adam created first? 
A: To give him a chance to say something.

Adam and Eve must have had a great marriage. Adam couldn't talk about his Mother's cooking, and Eve couldn't mention all the men she could/should have married.

One man goes to a shop to purchase an umbrella. He had been told that one could bargain for better prices in this shop
Man: How much does this umbrella cost?

Shopkeeper: Ok I’ll give it to you for Rs.150.
Man: Well can I have it for Rs. 75 then?
Shopkeeper: OK, take it for Rs. 100.
Man: Can I have it for Rs. 50?

Do you play jokes on your kids?
I Told My Kids I Ate All Their Halloween Candy. 60 Million views.

The scripture says God is our Father and we're his kids.

God is our shepherd, healer and our helper.
Sometimes, God is mean. He likes to play jokes on us.

A woman was praying to God. She said, "God!?" God responded, "Yes?" And the guy said, "Can I ask a question?" "Go right ahead," God said. "God, what is a million years to you?" God said, "A million years to me is only a second." "Hmmm," the man wondered. Then she asked, "God, what is a million dollars worth to you?" God said, "A million dollars to me is as a penny." So the woman said, "God, can I have a penny?" 
And God cheerfully said, "Sure! Just a second."

-----------------------------
He's not only mean he's funny too.

God was talking to one of his angels. He said, "I just figured out how to rotate the Earth so it creates this really incredible 24-hour period of alternating light and darkness." The angel said, "What are you going to do now?" God says, "Call it a day."

God asked Adam, "What's wrong with you?"

Adam said "I am lonely. I don't have anyone to talk to".

So, God said he was going to make Adam a companion and that it would be a woman. 

Adam said "Okay. What would be a woman like?"

God said, "The woman will make food for you, and when you discover clothing she'll wash it for you. She will always agree with every decision you make. She will bear your children and never ask you to get up in the middle of the night to take care of them. She will never nag you, and she will always be the first to admit she was wrong when you've had a disagreement. She will never have a headache and will freely give you love and passion whenever you need it."

Hearing this, Adam got excited. "That sounds terrific. When can you send her?"

So, God got serious and said "Well, a woman like that will cost you."

Adam asked God, "What will it cost?"

God replied, "An arm and a leg."

Then Adam asked, "What? What can I get for a rib?" And the rest is history. 

The joke is still on.
