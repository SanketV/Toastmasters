"Wait up!" That's what kids say. They don't say "wait", they say "Wait up! Hey, wait up!" 'Cause when you're little, your life is up. The future is up. Everything you want is up. "Wait up! Hold up! Shut up! Mom, I'll clean up! Let me stay up!" Parents of course are just the opposite. Everything is down. "Just calm down. Slow down. Come down here. Sit down. Put that down."

Do you play jokes on your kids?
I Told My Kids I Ate All Their Halloween Candy. 60 Million views.

The scripture says God is our Father and we're his kids.

God is our shepherd, healer and our helper.
Sometimes, God is mean. He likes to play jokes on us.

A woman was praying to God. She said, "God!?" God responded, "Yes?" And the guy said, "Can I ask a question?" "Go right ahead," God said. "God, what is a million years to you?" God said, "A million years to me is only a second." "Hmmm," the man wondered. Then she asked, "God, what is a million dollars worth to you?" God said, "A million dollars to me is as a penny." So the woman said, "God, can I have a penny?" 
And God cheerfully said, "Sure! Just a second."

-----------------------------
He's not only mean he's funny too.

God was talking to one of his angels. He said, "I just figured out how to rotate the Earth so it creates this really incredible 24-hour period of alternating light and darkness." The angel said, "What are you going to do now?" God says, "Call it a day."

-----------------------------

God asked Adam, "What's wrong with you?"

Adam said "I am lonely. I don't have anyone to talk to".

So, God said he was going to make Adam a companion and that it would be a woman. 

Adam said "Okay. What would be a woman like?"

God said, "The woman will make food for you, and when you discover clothing she'll wash it for you. She will always agree with every decision you make. She will bear your children and never ask you to get up in the middle of the night to take care of them. She will never nag you, and she will always be the first to admit she was wrong when you've had a disagreement. She will never have a headache and will freely give you love and passion whenever you need it."

Hearing this, Adam got excited. "That sounds terrific. When can you send her?"

So, God got serious and said "Well, a woman like that will cost you."

Adam asked God, "What will it cost?"

God replied, "An arm and a leg."

Then Adam asked, "What? What can I get for a rib?" And the rest is history. 

The joke is still on.

TEXAS TALKIN' - All about Texas!

Texas comes from the Hasinai Indian word tejas meaning friends or allies.


Here's what the heck they mean in the Lone Star State...
The engine's runnin' but ain't nobody driving = Not too smart
The porch light’s on but no one’s home.

As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party = An unwelcome person
Tighter than bark on a tree = Stingy
Big hat, no cattle = All talk, no action
We've howdied but we ain't shook yet = We've met, but haven't been formally introduced
He thinks the sun come up just to hear him crow = He thinks his s#%! doesn't stink
He broke his arm patting himself on the back.

She's got tongue enough for ten rows of teeth = She's a talker
It's so dry the trees are bribin' the dogs = Rain would be nice
Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly = Appearances can be deceiving
This ain't my first rodeo = I've been around the block
He looks like the dog's been keepin' him under the porch = U-G-L-Y
They ate supper before they said grace = They're living in sin
Time to paint your butt white and run with the antelope = Stop arguing and do as you're told
As full of wind as a corn-eating horse = A braggart
You can put your boots in the oven, but that doesn't make them biscuits = You can say whatever you want, but that doesn't change a thing

? The original "Lone Star" came into existence in 1821. Henry Smith, the Governor of the Mexican Providence of Texas, was signing some important papers, which made him realize that Texas needed a seal. His overcoat had five-pointed stars on the buttons, so he immediately cut one and stamped it on the documents. And, that's how the star actually came on the seal of Texas.

He’s riding a gravy train with biscuit wheels. - Lucky
He could sit on the fence and the birds would feed him. - Lucky
So hot the hens are laying hard-boiled eggs.  - Hot weather
