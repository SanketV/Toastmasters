We live in a competitive world. There's so much competition around. 
We live in a world where everyone tries to one-up everyone.
From our co-workers to newly freshly born babies. 

Social media pictures fuel fire to it.

I know this guy. He's an amazing guy. But, he's so much into competition. He always wants to compete.
It doesn't matter what the subject is. He wants to be an expert in everything.
And he thinks he's so good that if he does something, it means he surpassed everyone in that particular thing.
And it's terrific if it's healthy. 
But, one time, he went on twitter and announced
"Hey guys, I did something that no one has ever done in the history of the world. I stuffed three oreos in my mouth."

Another time, he went to Paris to see Eiffel tower.
He tweeted from there.
"Hey guys, I don't know why French keep water fountain in their bathrooms, but you won't believe what a different use I found for it."

These kind of things, too much competition, it affects your mental health. 
And that's why we have Vitality. If you meditate for 10 minutes, it offers you 10 lousy points.

But, it's good. You would think if you meditate, there won't be any competition in your mind.
One time I went to this retreat where people meditate. And I overheard these three students talking about their teachers.

One student said, "My teacher is so awesome. He can go 10 days without eating."

The second one said, "My teacher has so much self-control, he can go 20 days without sleep."

The third one said, "My teacher is so wise, he eats when he's hungry and sleeps when he's tired."

<<<<<<< HEAD
And I learnt it's only wise if competition is healthy. Otherwise, just do your thing!

"Wait up!" That's what kids say. They don't say "wait", they say "Wait up! Hey, wait up!" 'Cause when you're little, your life is up. The future is up. Everything you want is up. "Wait up! Hold up! Shut up! Mom, I'll clean up! Let me stay up!" Parents of course are just the opposite. Everything is down. "Just calm down. Slow down. Come down here. Sit down. Put that down."

You might wonder what it's like living with four kids.
Imagine you're drowning and someone hands you a kid.
