Four bar jokes!

A wealthy man was going for his evening walk when he saw two men eating grass by the roadside. He stopped by and asked them, ‘Why are you eating grass?’ ‘We don’t have any money for food,’ the men replied. ‘Oh, well, you can come with me to my house,’ instructed the man. But, sir, I have a wife and two children with me!’ ‘Bring them along!’ he replied. Suddenly the other man asked, ‘Sir, I have a wife and six children.’ ‘Bring them as well’ replied the rich man. As they were walking to the rich man’s house one of the poor guys said: ‘Sir you are so kind and merciful. Thank you for taking all of us with you.’ The wealthy man looked at them and replied: ‘I’m glad to do it. You’ll love my place where the grass is almost a foot tall.

Plato (Greek Philosopher) - was guru of Aristotole.
	"Be kind, because everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."

"In a world where you can be anything, be kind."

Don't judge my choices without understanding my reasons.
You never have enough information to judge anyone.

“We carry with us, as human beings, not just the capacity to be kind, but the very choice of kindness.”
