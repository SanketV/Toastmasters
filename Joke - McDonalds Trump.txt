I love fast food. I mentioned that in my Ice-Breaker.
I like President Donald Trump. 
I like Trump because he loves fast food.
What I like most about Trump is he only likes the classic burger chains. McDonalds, Burger King, Wendy's.
It's admirable that for a billionaire he doesn't seem to like higher-end burger chains like Fuddruckers, Five Guys or Shake Shack.

In January, he invited College Football champion Clemson Tigers to White House and served them burgers from these restaurants.
Football champions went there dressed in their suits to have cold as stone fast-food burgers and fries. 
I hope they all went drunk.

Trump loves burgers so much he has a nickname for them. Out of love he calls them - Hamberders. He tweeted that.

He also tweeted.
In order to fund his border wall, he will open a McDonald’s, a Burger King and Wendy's in the White House.
John Kelly, his then chief of staff, read it and he came to him furious. He said you can't do that.
Trump - Why not? I'm the president.
Kelly - You can't have all these burger joints here and no Taco Bell.
That was the first time Trump agreed with him on something.

But, apparently that plan didn't work out like many others.

Also, on January 20th, Trump tweeted,
Congratulations to everyone on a great holiday of MLK! 
He wrote I've always truly and deeply loved Mcdonald’s, Little Ceasars and KFC!

Few months ago, Trump wanted to declare emergency to secure funds to build a wall.
But, a real Trump emergency would be if McDonald's ran out of BigMacs.

We don't know yet. However, whenever we build a wall at the border and whether Mexico is going to pay for it or not, it's definite McDonald's is going to cater it.
