We’ve all been there: someone says something rude to us and our instinct is to strike back with a quick-witted retort. 

Personally, I don't encourage that. I've been trying to train myself to take the high-road when that happens.

But, sometimes we're inclined to take the low road in that kinda situation. 
But we don't have anything to say back? 
Precisely, we don't have a comeback line.

One of the Seinfeld episodes was about this. Its title was Comeback.

George was in an executive meeting. They had brought Shrimps for everyone.
George was stuffing himself like there was no tomorrow.

One of his colleagues, Reilly, comes over to him and says
"Hey George, the Ocean called. They're running out of shrimps"
And everybody starts laughing.

George couldn't think of a comeback line until later that night. 
He goes to his friends and tells them. But none of them likes that.
They ask him to come up with a new line. The way George is he wants to stick with that particular line.

Next week in a meeting, George brings a tray of shrimp himself and starts eating.
Reilly sees this and says the same thing again.

George was ready with his line.
"The jerkstore called. They're running out of you."

And Reilly says
"What's the difference? You're their all-time bestseller."

How awesome would it be if there's a site where you can review all your colleagues.
"Chad in payroll can't read emails for shit. But he brings donuts once in a while."

Research says there is always one person in the team that annoys everyone.
If that person leaves the team everyone's life would become easier.
If you think about your team, you should have that one person too.
Think about it. How much annoying that person is.
If you can't think of anyone, then you should quit your job. Because, that's definitely you.
