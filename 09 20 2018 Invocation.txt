“According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. 
 Number two is death. 
 Death is number two. Can you believe that? 
 This means to the average person, 
  if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy."

Some wise person said “Everybody wants to be somebody; just nobody wants to grow.”
We all try here to improve our skills.
And the same wise person said "If at first you don't succeed, lower your expectations."

Albert Einstein said “Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.” 
May we learn from yesterday's mistakes and challenges. 
Today, may we live in the moment, taking joy in our wonderful meeting. 
And may we increase in hope that we improve our speeches for tomorrow through the helpful support and learning that we receive here, 
and may we hope that one of us goes to an annual Toastmaster's event and brighten our club's name!
