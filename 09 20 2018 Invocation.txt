“According to recent studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. 
 Number two is death. 
 Death is number two. Think about that. 
 This means to the average person, 
  if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy."

A philosopher once attended a seminar on "Personal Growth".
He was so pumped up.
He said “Everybody wants to be somebody. Just nobody wants to grow.”
And he determined to change certain things about himslef.

But, personal growth is difficult. It's uncomfortable. Because, you've never been there before. You've never been that version of yourself.

And after several months of trying, the philosopher was not able to achieve the goal he set it for himself.
So one day he declared again "If at first you don't succeed, lower your expectations."

Let's begin our meeting today with a quote from an iconic philosopher scientist, 
Albert Einstein, he once said, 
“Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow.” 	

May we learn from yesterday's mistakes and challenges. 
Today, may we live in the moment, taking joy in our wonderful meeting.
And may we hope that we improve our speeches for tomorrow through the benevolent support and learning that we receive here, 
and may we also hope that one of us goes to an annual Toastmaster's event and brighten our club's name!
