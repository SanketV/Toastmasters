Ikea

One of my favorite places on the earth is located just 2 miles from my house.
I love going there. Only regret is I don't go there as often as I would like to. 
Yes, an Ikea store is like Disneyland for me.

Last time we went there was to buy tea-candles.
We ended up spending 6 hours and 200 dollars. 
When we returned home we realized we forgot the candles.

It's amazing.
 
Every time you go there you would want to re-model your entire house.
But, then you realize it will take two days just to put-together a bed-side table.

I interviewed there very early in my career for a part-time job.
As soon as I entered the room, first thing they asked me was to assemble a chair so I would have something to sit on.

If you shop at Ikea, you know they have some kinda fetish with Allen wrench.
Doesn't matter what you buy it comes with it. From a bathroom stool to a king-size bed.
I don't understand why!

I love their restaurant too. 
One time I got pasta from there and for some reason they had run out of forks.
No forks. Luckily I had Allen wrench with me and that's what I had to eat my pasta with.

On a completely unrelated note,
Donald Trump - our adorable president.
He recently learned about Ikea and how you can buy cabinets there.
Apparently he didn't know about it.
So he tweeted,
Dear Sweden, thanks for the amazing Ikea.
I'm going to re-build my cabinet.
Please accept my order of twenty four cabinet ministers.
