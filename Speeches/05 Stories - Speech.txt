1. The opening
	something that will immediately pull your audience in. For example: “Are you afraid of strang-ers? Have the words ‘stranger danger’ been ingrained in your brain, making you reluctant to trust anyone? Let me share with you an experience I had that left me thanking God for the kindness of a stranger.”

	Let me start by asking you guys a simple question?
	Do you have a favorite actor/actress or favorite celebrity?
	Yes, we all do.
	Now I'm not gonna ask you who your favorite celebrity is. Therefore, I'm not gonna judge.
	I expect you to not judge either when I say my favorite celebrity as of now is Cardi B.

	Now have you ever given a thought why we like certain celebrities.	

2. First Paragraph
	setting up the scene of your story and the circum-stances. (Your car broke down in a snow-storm and you find yourself stranded.

3. Next Main Paragraph
	the body of the story. (A stranger stopped to help you with your car and followed up with a series of kind actions.)

4. Second Main Paragraph
	the out-come of the story. (The good Samari-tan took you to the garage and you made it home safely.)

5. The closing
	something the audi-ence will find memorable or that ties your speech back to your opening. For example, “So the next time your brain screams ‘Stranger Danger,’ trust your instincts, but also be open to the kindness of strangers and to the possibility that compassion, consideration and civility are alive and well in the world.”
