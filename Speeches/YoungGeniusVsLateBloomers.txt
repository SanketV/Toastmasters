Why flowers bloom late.

	Flowers know when to bloom because of a gene named Apetala1.
	 A lone master gene, Apetala1 triggers the reproductive development of a plant, telling it when it's time to start blossoming. 
	Plants blossom at different times because several factors, including the weather, temperature and the amount of sunlight the plant receives, 
	all of which influence its reproductive development. 
	Information about these conditions is relayed to Apetala1, 
	which activates when it senses that the timing is right to commence flowering.
