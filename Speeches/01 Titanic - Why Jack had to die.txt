Today I want to talk about an event that affected millions of lives all over the world.
I want to address a question that has kept many people awake at night for many years.
This is a very signficant cultural event. Or, if you will, a very signficant pop-cultural event.
You all know this guy Jack. So, let's get the cat out of the bag.

Yeah. We're talking about Jack Dawson in Titanic.

There has been a burning question over the years whether Jack could've fit on to that floating door with Rose.
Whether she should've scooted a little bit, made some space for the poor guy, so he could've survived too.

Discovery channel has a show called Mythbusters, 
and they experimented on the show whether, at least physics wise, Jack could've survived on the board with Rose or not.

James Cameron who was the writer and director of the film, came on the show and said Jack had to die.
Because, he wrote that in the script on page 147.

But, why is that?

The movie starts with Jack appearing like an underdog hero. And Rose as a damsel in distress.
She says in voice-over that she felt Titanic was a slave ship taking her to America in chains.
And that she was standing on a cliff and there was no one who noticed or cared.

Then she runs to the back of the ship and tries to jump from there.  

Conveniently, Jack pops into her life right then to stop her.

Next day, they try to know each other and all of a sudden Rose is learning how to spit like a man.

Now, as I said, Jack appears to be the hero of the story. However, the real hero of the story is Rose.
In a story, hero is someone who goes on a journey. Either physical or emotional.
Hero is an archetype. Another archetype is animus defined by a psychoanalyst from Switzerland Carl Jung.

It means the musculine side of a woman's personality. The opposite is Anima which means feminine side of a man's personality.

So, Rose starts acquiring all the musculine traits from Jack starting with learning how to spit.
Now, this story is set in 1912. It doesn't apply to current era.

With every scene, Rose becomes more and more assertive, daring and bold. 
She shows a middle finger to her fiance's henchman. 
She asks Jack to paint her like one of his french girls.
And she pursues him to romance her.

Later, she ditches her contolling mother and her intimidating fiance.
She even uses the spitting skill she learnt before to spit on her fiance's face.

Now, on the other hand, Jack doesn't have to learn anything througout the story. He is just a magic pixie dream boy.
Which means he's charming, handsome, cool with no inner conflict and with no goal to pursue.
The commonly known counterpart is magic pixie dream girl which was very frequent in rom-com movies.

After the ship hits the iceberg and starts to sink and once they're in the water.
Jack asks Rose when she was holding his hand to promise to never let go. She promises and ironically after few minutes lets him go.

The promise he asked for was to never give up on her life.

When she reaches America, she becomes a new person with a new name - Rose Dawson.
For her, the ship was a symbol of a society that was unequal and suppressed her.

With the ship at the bottom of the ocean, she becomes a free woman.

Titanic is seen as an epic romance. However, it was also about a person's will to live and about separation and death.

Jack's purpose in the story was to enable Rose's character growth.
He enters her life exactly when she was ready to die.
He leaves her life exactly when she was ready to live.

The story wouldn't have the same meaning if Jack had survived.
And that's why in the end he had to go and he had to die!


______________________________________________________________________________________________
Also, by Hollywood standard, a movie should have a happy ending. It should give hope to the audience in the end.
But, whoever saw Titanic knew beforehand that the ship would sink and hundreds of people would die.
So, it already had a tragic ending.
And on top of that, an endearing character dies too. Which is a double whammy.
Double tragic end which is generally not accepted by the audience.

But, Cameron did that anyway. So, why did character of Jack have to die?


Titanic is mostly seen as an epic romance where two people fall in love. 
However, the main story is about finding the will to live.


Story is about finding the will to live.
	
	- Class system.
	- In the beginning of the movie,
		old Rose says that for her it was a slave ship.
		She felt that she was being taken back to America in chains.
		She was depressed.
		At the dining scene, she says, she was feeling like she was standing at a precipice of a hill and no one to pull back, no one cared or no one even noticed.
		And then she goes and tries to commit suicide.

	That's when Jack magically and conveniently appears in her life.

	They briefly lock eyes before this.
	But, they actually meet at this precise moment when Rose needs him the most to stop her from ending her life and to show her a better way to get out of her misery.


In the beginning of the movie, Jack appears as an underdog. And Rose appears as a damsel in distress who needed to be saved.

But, real hero goes on a journey that changes his/her life, who acquires the transformation.

Jack is an equivalent of a manic pixie dream girl role, which would be a manic pixie dream boy.
If you see these girl characters in some rom-coms, they have eccentric qualities, they're very beautiful, and they do not have any inner conflict.
They're just there to teach the male protagonist a lesson of life. 500 Days of Summer, Along Came Polly, Elizabethtown.

Manic pixie dream boy - he's free, he's daring, he's inspiring and he's handsome.
He's also everything that's missing from our protagonist's life which is Rose's life.
His purpose in the movie is to enable Rose's character growth. He gives Rose all the tools to survive.

The last scene - Promise me you will never let go. 
She says - I promise Jack! And ironically she lets him go.

Titanic also explores the theme of value over wealth. 
Values matter and not money or wealth. 
And that's the reason old Rose throws the necklace in the ocean back to Jack.
	
Carl Jung described the animus as the unconscious masculine side of a woman, and the anima as the unconscious feminine side of a man
Rose says teach me to ride a horse like a man, chew a tobacco like a man and spit like a man.
She finds strenght of will, determination to act. These are just historically traditional traits of men.

Titanic is microcosm or a miniature version of a very structured, oppressive, unequal society.
It was set in 1912 where women weren't allowed to vote or women didn't have many liberties.

After getting in touch with her Animus, She becomes extremely daring and bold.
She ditches her fiance, her oppressing mother and her social class.

She even pursues Jack in romancing her. She becomes assertive.
When she arrives at the shore, she assumes new name. She takes Jack's last name and becomes Rose Dawson.
She transforms into a new person.

Titanic's story had a purpose for Jack. 
The purpose was to enable her character's growth.

He exists in order to empower Rose and give her a will to live. 

And when that purpose was fulfilled. He had to go and that's why he had to die!
