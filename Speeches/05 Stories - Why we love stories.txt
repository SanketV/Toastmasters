I'm going to talk about a topic that is so deeply ingrained in all of us.
Let me ask you a question?

Everyone likes stories. We like to listen to stories, read stories, watch stories (movies, TV, theatre) and tell stories. In fact, stories are our normal mode of information processing. Stories are so normal to us that we don’t even stop to think about why that is.

Story
When fire was invented and their bellies were full. They gathered around it.

When we meet a new person
Tell me your story
Where are you from?
What do you do?

Shakespeare
Life is a stage. Everyone is a character
We look different even though we're from same region, same race.
We talk different. 
We dress different. We all have certain style of dressing sense.

We're inclined to tell our stories. If we don't, you know what happens? We need someone to listen. Maybe we will even pay someone to listen to us. Like a therapist.

Songs that tell stories. The song that you liked the most must be telling you a story. Imagine which is your all time favorite song and why you like it?

Cardi B songs - 

Movies and TV shows.


Bollywood - Indian Film Industry - 1000 movies a year. 

Morale tales. That's how we teach kids.

Sales - Advertising.
	

Stories are how we are wired. Stories take place in the imagination. To the human brain, imagined experiences are processed the same as real experiences. Stories create genuine emotions, presence (the sense of being somewhere), and behavioral responses.
