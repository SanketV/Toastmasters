I'm going to talk about a topic that is so deeply ingrained in all of us.
Let me ask you a question?

Everyone likes stories. We like to listen to stories, read stories, watch stories and tell stories. In fact, stories are our normal mode of information processing. Stories are so normal to us that we don’t even stop to think about why that is.

Anthropologists - people who study human societies, cultures and their development, tell us that storytelling is central to human existence. It's common to every known culture. 


Storytelling is a joke telling.
Change is inherent in stories.
 
Drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty.

Story
When fire was invented and their bellies were full. They gathered around it.
Stories were used to pass knowledge from generation to generation.

When we meet a new person
Tell me your story
Where are you from?
What do you do?

Shakespeare
Life is a stage. Everyone is a character
We look different even though we're from same region, same race.
We talk different. 
We dress different. We all have certain style of dressing sense.

We're inclined to tell our stories. If we don't, you know what happens? We need someone to listen. Maybe we will even pay someone to listen to us. Like a therapist.

Songs that tell stories. The song that you liked the most must be telling you a story. Imagine which is your all time favorite song and why you like it?

Movies and TV shows.

		British psychologist Edward B. Titchener (1867–1927) might have argued that we become glued to complex, 
		emotionally-charged stories because of our ability to recognize the feelings of others.
 A newly identified phenomenon at the time, Titchener coined the term empathy in 1909. In addition to identifying others' discomfort or elation, "cognitive empathy" examines how humans can also adopt others' psychological perspectives, including those of fictional characters. It's such a universal emotional state that psychological tests (through the use of puppets, pictures, and videos) have even been developed to study empathy in preschool-age children.

Stories are how we are wired. Stories take place in the imagination. To the human brain, imagined experiences are processed the same as real experiences. Stories create genuine emotions, presence (the sense of being somewhere), and behavioral responses.

----------
In the realm of narrative psychology, a person’s life story is not a Wikipedia biography of the facts and events of a life, but rather the way a person integrates those facts and events internally—picks them apart and weaves them back together to make meaning. This narrative becomes a form of identity, in which the things someone chooses to include in the story, and the way she tells it, can both reflect and shape who she is.  A life story doesn’t just say what happened, it says why it was important, what it means for who the person is, for who they’ll become, and for what happens next.

When people tell others about themselves, they kind of have to do it in a narrative way—that’s just how humans communicate. But when people think about their lives to themselves, is it always in a narrative way, with a plot that leads from one point to another? ***There's an old adage that everyone has a book inside of them. 

***Storytelling, then—fictional or nonfictional, realistic or embellished with dragons—is a way of making sense of the world around us.

“Life is incredibly complex, there are lots of things going on in our environment and in our lives at all times, and in order to hold onto our experience, we need to make meaning out of it,” Adler says. “The way we do that is by structuring our lives into stories.”

Stories are life, life is stories.
