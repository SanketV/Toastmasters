Why flowers bloom late.

	Flowers know when to bloom because of a gene named Apetala1.
	 A lone master gene, Apetala1 triggers the reproductive development of a plant, telling it when it's time to start blossoming. 
	Plants blossom at different times because several factors, including the weather, temperature and the amount of sunlight the plant receives, 
	all of which influence its reproductive development. 
	Information about these conditions is relayed to Apetala1, 
	which activates when it senses that the timing is right to commence flowering.


1990s
While completing these films, Jackson's drug addiction had worsened. After previously overdosing on heroin several times, Jackson gave up the drug in favor of cocaine.[28] After seeing the effects of his addiction, his family entered him into a New York rehab clinic.[12][29] When he successfully completed rehab, Jackson appeared in Jungle Fever, as a crack cocaine addict, a role which Jackson called cathartic as he was recovering from his addiction.[7] Jackson commented on the transition, "It was a funny kind of thing. By the time I was out of rehab, about a week or so later I was on set and we were ready to start shooting."[30] The film was so acclaimed that the 1991 Cannes Film Festival created a special "Supporting Actor" award just for him
