I visited India last month for 2 weeks.
Whenever I went there before, I would mostly stay in my hometown.
This time I took another trip in northern part of the country. My wife was nice enough to arrange it for me. Got to give credit.

Now, India is known for its rich past and cultural heritage. It's a birthplace of yoga, meditation, buddhism and many other things. Tourism-wise too it has a lot to offer. But, one of the things it is most famous for is its spirtiual experience.

Steve Jobs was there in his youth looking for spiritual guidance. Mark Zuckerberg went there in 2008 for similar experience. Beatles-a british band were there in 60s and now the ashram is named after them.

I didn't get a chance to have full-blown spiritual experience. But, I visited three different places which gave me similar experience. So, even though I grew up there and had been there many times, this was something different.

First place is called Vaishno Devi. It's a shrine of a goddess in the mountains. There's an 8 miles hike which is not bad at all. Almost a million people visit it every year. We stood in line without shoes in freezing temperature and rain water for 90 minutes to go in. I would've never done it in normal circumstances. But, I was astonished next day that I didn't fall sick or even get cold.

There were lot of, I mean lot of monkeys on the way. If you think, they can hurt you, you're right, they can. But like many things in India there's no logical explanation for that.

Also, this is the first meal we had on our trip and it was amazing. It's bread made out of corn, spinach curry, butter cubes and sweet. It was out of this world.

Second place is in Amritsar, Punjab called Golden Temple. It was built in 15th century. The roof is supposedly made of gold. It's a Sikh temple which is a religion. 
Sikh men have beard and wear turbans. They have migrated all around the world. 
Canada has a large population of Sikhs.

The most prominent Sikh person in the world is this guy Ajay Banga. He's CEO of MasterCard since 2010. 

Now there was nothing special to see in the temple as such. But, there was a lot more to experience. I visited it twice in two days. Both days, I could feel the aura, the tranquility, the calm in the ambience. This is one of the top sites for spiritual experience in the country. Very popular among foreign travelers.

Also, this has 24 hours kitchen mostly run by volunteers from cooking, cleaning and serving. Food is free for all the visitors.

Also, each of 29 states in India kinda has its own cuisine. But, the food that is known as Indian food across the world comes from this state of Punjab. It's Punjabi cuisine which consists of Naan, Butter masala and other gravy-based dishes. They all come from here. 

I also had Lassi which is yogurt based drink. Traditionally, the state was known for farming and agriculture. Therefore, farmers' diet was heavy with creme and butter specially when they're vegetarians.

I was very excited to go there and eat where it originated. 
Because, believe it or not, I love Indian food.

Third place was the capital of India, city of New Delhi. I have a wonderful cousin there and she hosted us. We visited India Gate which is a memorial for the soldiers that died in first world war. I didn't know that until I visited it. 
  
Then we visited another temple called Akshardham. This is relatively a new one. Only 14 years old. 

Columbus discovered America in 1492 when he wanted to go to India.
The guy who built Taj Mahal, his grandfather's grandfather, great-great grandpa invaded India and established his rule. That was in 1500.
His dynasty ruled for more than 300 years.
Then came British and they ruled for almost 200 years.

So, India was robbed and ravaged of its glory.



So, I enjoyed the chaos, cacophony and surroundings.
